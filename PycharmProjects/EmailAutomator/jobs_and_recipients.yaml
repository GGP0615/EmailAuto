          About the job
          At Zelis, we Get Stuff Done. So, let’s get to it!

          A Little About Us

          Zelis is modernizing the healthcare financial experience for all by providing a connected platform that bridges the gaps and aligns interests across payers, providers, and healthcare consumers. This platform serves more than 750 payers, including the top 5 national health plans, BCBS insurers, regional health plans, TPAs and self-insured employers, and millions of healthcare providers and consumers. Zelis sees across the system to identify, optimize, and solve problems holistically with technology built by healthcare experts—driving real, measurable results for clients.

          A Little About You

          You bring a unique blend of personality and professional expertise to your work, inspiring others with your passion and dedication. Your career is a testament to your diverse experiences, community involvement, and the valuable lessons you've learned along the way. You are more than just your resume; you are a reflection of your achievements, the knowledge you've gained, and the personal interests that shape who you are.

          Position Overview

          Zelis is seeking a Product Manager with strong technical fluency and a passion for AI/ML to join our growing Data & Technology organization. This is an exciting opportunity for a rising product leader to drive the development of next-generation AI use cases, with end-to-end ownership—from idea to deployment.

          As an AI Product Manager, you’ll work closely with data scientists, data engineers, and software development teams to define, deliver, and scale AI-powered products. You’ll help guide discovery, shape strategy, and ensure delivery, all while translating complex business challenges into real technical solutions.

          Ideal for candidates with 3–5 years of product management experience, particularly those who have partnered closely with data teams and are ready to grow deeper into AI/ML product development.

          What You’ll Do

          Own the product lifecycle for AI/ML-based features and services, from discovery through launch and iteration.
          Work closely with data scientists, ML engineers, and software teams to scope, refine, and deliver technical solutions that drive business value.
          Lead product discovery to uncover unmet business needs and define clear, technically grounded product requirements.
          Partner with business stakeholders to translate strategic goals into actionable product roadmaps.
          Serve as the primary point of contact for your AI product areas, helping connect business context with technical implementation.
          Facilitate the intake, evaluation, and prioritization of new AI/ML use cases.
          Track and report on product KPIs, adoption metrics, and impact stories.
          Work with cross-functional teams, including engineering, operations, architecture, marketing, and customer success to ensure smooth delivery and adoption.
          Tell a compelling story around the real-world impact of AI in healthcare—mapping product decisions back to patient or provider outcomes.

          Who You Are

          You have 3+ years of product management experience, ideally in a technical or data-heavy environment.
          You are passionate about AI/ML and have helped deliver or manage AI or advanced analytics products.
          You have strong technical fluency: you’re comfortable talking about model infrastructure, APIs, data pipelines, and limitations of ML, even if you’re not a developer.
          You bring experience with tools like SQL, Python, R, or cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)—even if only at the conceptual or analytical level.
          You understand the nuances of AI/ML product lifecycles, including experimentation, model iteration, and performance metrics.
          You’ve worked in agile environments, and you’re confident with tools like Jira and Confluence.
          You’re comfortable navigating ambiguity, proactively managing competing priorities, and influencing stakeholders without authority.
          You’re intellectually curious, action-oriented, and love working at the intersection of business, data, and technology.

          Nice to Have

          Experience in the healthcare industry, especially working with claims, clinical, or financial datasets.
          Familiarity with ML Ops practices, GenAI solutions, or prompt engineering.
          Experience supporting AI product adoption across business units or customer groups.
          Exposure to tools like Snowflake, Databricks, SageMaker, or vector databases.

          This Role Is Not For You If

          You’ve only worked in project coordination or business analyst roles without direct product ownership.
          You lack technical fluency or comfort speaking with engineers and data scientists.
          You expect a team of product managers or designers reporting to you—this is an individual contributor role.

          Why Join Us

          Be part of a transformative data & AI team within a healthcare technology leader.
          Work on real-world AI problems with measurable business and human impact.
          Gain significant visibility across executive stakeholders, product, and engineering.
          Enjoy flexibility, autonomy, and a culture that rewards initiative and learning.

          Location and Workplace Flexibility

          We have offices in Atlanta GA, Boston MA, Morristown NJ, Plano TX, St. Louis MO, St. Petersburg FL, and Hyderabad, India. We foster a hybrid and remote friendly culture, and all our employee's work locations are based on the needs of the position and determined by the Leadership team. In-office work and activities, if applicable, vary based on the work and team objectives in accordance with Company policies.
